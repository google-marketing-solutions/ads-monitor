# Collectors

Exporting data from Google Ads is done via collectors. Collector represents a query associated with a short alias. Collectors can be bundled into registries to simplify getting common set of metrics.

You can specify collectors with `--collectors <collector_name>` CLI argument. Some collectors available by default, other you need to specify explicitly.

There are two types of collectors - *registry* (contains other collectors grouped logically) and *collectors* themselves.
